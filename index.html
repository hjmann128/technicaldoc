            <header>What is JavaScript?</header>
           <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p> 
           <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Fr端h (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
            <code>let Fr端h = "foobar"</code>
            <p>But, the variable fr端h is not the same as Fr端h because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
            <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
            <header>Comments</header>
            <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>
            <code>// a one line comment

                /* this is a longer,
                 * multi-line comment
                 */
                
                /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */</code>
                <p>Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42 </code> . This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.</li>
                <li>With the keyword const or let. For example, <code>y = 13</code>. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See Variable scope below.)
                </li>
                <p>You can declare variables to unpack values from Object Literals using the Destructuring Assignment syntax. For example, <code>let { bar } = foo</code> This will create a variable named bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object foo.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>(function(){
                "use strict";
                /* Start of your code */
                function greetMe(yourName) {
                  alert('Hello ' + yourName);
                }
              
                greetMe('World');
                /* End of your code */
              })();</code>
              <p>Press Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter (or click the Run button) to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
              <p>But for now, remember to always include the (function(){"use strict"; before your code, and add })(); to the end of your code. The strict mode and IIFE articles explain what those do, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following:</p>
              <ol>
                  <li>Prevent semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners.</li>
                  <li>Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g., having something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).</li>
              </ol>
